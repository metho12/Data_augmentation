
Data Augmentation :is a technique of artificially increasing the training set by creating modified copies of a dataset using existing data.

Different way to accomplish data augmentation Such as flipping, resizing, cropping, brightness and, contrast

When Should You Use Data Augmentation?  
1- To prevent models from overfiting.
2- The initial training set is too small.
3- To improve the model accuracy.
3- To reduce the operational cost of labeling and cleaning the raw datasets.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Limitations of data augmentation:

1- The biases in the original dataset persist in the augmented data.
2- Quality assurance for data augmentation is expensive. 
3- Finding an effective data augmentation approach can be challenging.

Note: I used tensorflow offical tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification as a reference and made bunch of changes to make it simpler.
